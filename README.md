# 🗺️ Tour system web application

This is a web application for tour reservation, it was originally published in this [repository](https://github.com/Dtrasla/DesWeb2022), and it's a project developed for our web development class. Here we used a DDD architecture, instead of a the conventional MVC architecture. For controlling many to many relationships into the database, we used RabbitMQ.

## 📚 Tools implemented

* Spring boot - Backend framework
* Vue js - Frontend framework
* MariaDB - Database
* RabbitMQ - Storing data in the database
* Hibernate - Object Relational Manager (ORM)

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

* Yo need to use [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/idea/) because it'll download all the dependencies utilized in the backend.
* You'll need to have [node js](https://nodejs.org/es/download/) installed
